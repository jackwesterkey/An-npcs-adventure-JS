# Zelda-like game made in JavaScript with Kaboom.js

Art made by Momen

Code made by JSLegendDev

I changed a lot in this code and added D-pad support so it works with a USB controller (both Xbox and DualShock).

For now, it only moves the player and does not include a sword attack.

I also added shooting and cleaned up the code in my own way.

Additionally, I changed the art.

I made it an executable file. (Using electron and nw.js)

Open the readme to learn how to use it.

I also added bullets, but I commented them out in the code. Just remove the comments, and it will be usable.
